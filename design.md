#### Overview

Ancient Archer is Closed Source Game Engine in development.

#### Context

Includes 3D/2D Renderering, Math, Controls, Display, Cameras, Shaders, Lighting, and Sound. A user can script modules into games or anything desired using their custom assets.

#### Goals

Metrics: How many games have been built with it? How much functionality does it encompass? How stable is it? Does it have tests? Is it ready for use? Is it properly licensed? Is it properly accredited?

#### Milestones

Quarterly Release Update Planned for the future. TBA

Attempted to build 10 demos with it at below dates (game a week challenge)
Dates: April 28, 2019 - July 7, 2019
1. tactics
2. rats scavaging
3. ENDLESS RUNNER
4. sidescroller fighter
5. battle royale
6. mmo
7. plant growing
8. space shooter bullet hell
9. museum, how many effects
10. acid frog

#### The Solution

Continue expanding and improving Ancient Archer Game Engine.
* Programming Language: C++ std17
* Additional Libraries: 
    * glad for OpenGL 3.30 graphics pipeline
    * glfw3 for windowing and input
    * SDL2_mixer for playing sound
    * glm for 3d math
    * stb_image to load texture
    * assimp to load meshes and models

Ancient Archer should allow for games to be built on it with relative ease.

#### Alternative Solutions

* Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot Engine, Game Maker, ... you name it.

#### Testability, Monitoring and Alerting

* Comes with prebuilt examples and tests, built and expanded as features are added.
* Logging System TBA


#### Detailed Scoping and Timeline

* Timelines TBA
