#### Goals

Ancient Archer is a work in progress. 

Metrics: How many games have been built with it? How much functionality does it encompass? How stable is it? Does it have tests? Is it ready for use? Is it properly licensed? Is it properly accredited?

#### Milestones

Ancient Archer is being used for a sequence of custom games to be built. It should be a new animal by the end of this 10 game project. One game is being worked on per week.

#### Existing Solutions

My partially built engine AncientArcher

* Programming Language: C++ std14
* Additional Libraries: 
    * glad for OpenGL 3.30 graphics pipeline
    * glfw3 for windowing and input
    * SDL2_mixer for playing sound
    * glm for 3d math
    * stb_image to load texture
    * assimp to load meshes and models

#### Proposed Solution

Countine on Ancient Archer OpenGL project.

Ancient Archer should allow for games to be built on it with relative ease.

#### Alternative Solutions

* Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot Engine, Game Maker, ... you name it.

#### Testability, Monitoring and Alerting

* ToDo

#### Detailed Scoping and Timeline
